# Working with PyTorch Geometric

This series of notebooks have been made in correspondence with the tutorials by Antonio Longa, and is mostly self-contained.

*Note:* Markdown in the notebooks on GitHub are not able to render in-line LaTeX and it would be better to clone the repository and run it either on colab or local jupyter installation.
